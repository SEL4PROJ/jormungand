Poly/ML for Isabelle
====================

This compilation of Poly/ML 5.6 (http://www.polyml.org) is based on the source
distribution from https://github.com/polyml/polyml/releases/tag/v5.6/.

On Linux the sources have changed as follows, in order to evade a
potential conflict of /bin/bash versus /bin/sh -> dash (notably on
Ubuntu and Debian):

diff -r src-orig/libpolyml/process_env.cpp src/libpolyml/process_env.cpp
228c228
<                 execve("/bin/sh", argv, environ);
---
>                 execvp("bash", argv);


The included build script is used like this:

  ./build src x86-linux --with-gmp
  ./build src x86_64-linux --with-gmp
  ./build src x86-darwin --without-gmp
  ./build src x86_64-darwin --without-gmp
  ./build src x86-windows --with-gmp
  ./build src x86_64-windows --with-gmp

Also note that the separate "sha1" library module is required for
efficient digestion of strings according to SHA-1.
