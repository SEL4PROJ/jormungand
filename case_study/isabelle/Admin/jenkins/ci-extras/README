This contains a Maven project which assembles all third-party dependencies for
the Jenkins build script and packages them up as an Isabelle component.

To produce the Isabelle component, run './package'. This will create a tarball
in the 'dist' folder.

The constituent packages, including sources and individual copyright notices,
can be found in the 'contrib' folder.
