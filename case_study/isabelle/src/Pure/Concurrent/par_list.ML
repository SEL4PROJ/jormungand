Parallel list combinators.

Notes:

  * These combinators only make sense if the operator (function or
    predicate) applied to the list of operands takes considerable
    time.  The overhead of scheduling is significantly higher than
    just traversing the list of operands sequentially.

  * The order of operator application is non-deterministic.  Watch out
    for operators that have side-effects or raise exceptions!
