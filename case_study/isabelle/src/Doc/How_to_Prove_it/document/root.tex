\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
  How does one perform induction on the length of a list? How are numerals
  converted into \isa{Suc} terms? How does one prove equalities in rings
  and other algebraic structures?

  This document is a collection of practical hints and techniques for dealing
  with specific frequently occurring situations in proofs in Isabelle/HOL.
  Not arbitrary proofs but proofs that refer to material that is part of
  \isa{Main} or \isa{Complex\_Main}.

  This is \emph{not} an introduction to
\begin{itemize}
\item proofs in general; for that see mathematics or logic books.
\item Isabelle/HOL and its proof language; for that see the tutorial
  \cite{ProgProve} or the reference manual~\cite{IsarRef}.
\item the contents of theory \isa{Main}; for that see the overview
  \cite{Main}.
\end{itemize}
