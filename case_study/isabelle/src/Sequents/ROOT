    Various Sequent Calculi for Classical, Linear, and Modal Logic.

    Much of the work in Modal logic was done by Martin Coen. Thanks to Rajeev
    Gore' for supplying the inference system for S43. Sara Kalvala reorganized
    the files and supplied Linear Logic. Jacob Frost provided some improvements
    to the syntax of sequents.
