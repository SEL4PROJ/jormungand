subsection \<open>Maximal filter = Ultrafilter\<close>

text \<open>
   A filter \<open>F\<close> is an ultrafilter iff it is a maximal filter,
   i.e. whenever \<open>G\<close> is a filter and @{prop "F \<subseteq> G"} then @{prop "F = G"}
\<close>

text \<open>
  Lemma that shows existence of an extension to what was assumed to
  be a maximal filter. Will be used to derive contradiction in proof of
  property of ultrafilter.
