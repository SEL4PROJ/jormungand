text{* We were lucky that the proof was automatic, except for the
induction. In general, such proofs will not be so easy. The automation is
partly due to the right inversion rules that we set up as automatic
elimination rules that decompose big-step premises.

text{* The proof is intentionally an apply script because it merely composes
the rules of Hoare logic. Of course, in a few places side conditions have to
be proved. But since those proofs are 1-liners, a structured proof is
overkill. In fact, we shall learn later that the application of the Hoare
rules can be automated completely and all that is left for the user is to
provide the loop invariants and prove the side-conditions. *}
