  This file demonstrates some of the typical scenarios 
  when transfer or transfer_prover does not produce expected results
  and how the user might handle such cases.
*)

(* As an example, we use finite sets. The following command recreates the environment in which
   the type of finite sets was created and allows us to do transferring on this type. *)

subsection \<open>1. A missing transfer rule\<close>

(* We will simulate the situation in which there is not any transfer rules for fmember. *)
declare fmember.transfer[transfer_rule del] fmember_transfer[transfer_rule del]

(* We want to prove the following theorem about |\<subseteq>| by transfer *)
lemma "(A |\<subseteq>| B) = fBall A (\<lambda>x. x |\<in>| B)"
apply transfer
(* 
   Transfer complains that it could not find a transfer rule for |\<subseteq>| with a matching transfer
   relation. An experienced user could notice that |\<in>| was transferred to |\<in>| by a 
   a default reflexivity transfer rule (because there was not any genuine transfer rule for |\<in>|)
   and fBall was transferred to Ball using the transfer relation pcr_fset. Therefore transfer
   is looking for a transfer rule for |\<subseteq>| with a transfer relation that mixes op= and pcr_fset.
   This situation might be confusing because the real problem (a missing transfer rule) propagates
   during the transferring algorithm and manifests later in an obfuscated way. Fortunately,
   we could inspect the behavior of transfer in a more interactive way to pin down the real problem.

   Here we can realize that not an expected transfer rule was chosen. 
   We stumbled upon a limitation of Transfer: the tool used the rule Lifting_Set.UNIV_transfer,
   which transfers UNIV to UNIV and assumes that the transfer relation has to be bi-total.
   The problem is that at this point the transfer relation is not known (it is represented by
   a schematic variable ?R) and therefore in order to discharge the assumption "bi_total ?R", ?R is
   instantiated to op=. If the relation had been known (we wish pcr_fset op=, which is not bi-total),
   the assumption bi_total pcr_fset op= could not have been discharged and the tool would have 
   backtracked and chosen Lifting.right_total_UNIV_transfer, which assumes only right-totalness 
   (and pcr_fset is right-total).
