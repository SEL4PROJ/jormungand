Inductive relation "tls" for the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol.
This protocol is essentially the same as SSL 3.0.

Abstracted from "The TLS Protocol, Version 1.0" by Tim Dierks and Christopher
Allen, Transport Layer Security Working Group, 21 May 1997,
INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-tls-protocol-03.txt.  Section numbers below refer
to that memo.

An RSA cryptosystem is assumed, and X.509v3 certificates are abstracted down
to the trivial form {A, publicKey(A)}privateKey(Server), where Server is a
global signing authority.

A is the client and B is the server, not to be confused with the constant
Server, who is in charge of all public keys.

The model assumes that no fraudulent certificates are present, but it does
assume that some private keys are to the spy.

REMARK.  The event "Notes A \<lbrace>Agent B, Nonce PMS\<rbrace>" appears in ClientKeyExch,
CertVerify, ClientFinished to record that A knows M.  It is a note from A to
herself.  Nobody else can see it.  In ClientKeyExch, the Spy can substitute
his own certificate for A's, but he cannot replace A's note by one for himself.

The Note event avoids a weakness in the public-key model.  Each
agent's state is recorded as the trace of messages.  When the true client (A)
invents PMS, he encrypts PMS with B's public key before sending it.  The model
does not distinguish the original occurrence of such a message from a replay.
In the shared-key model, the ability to encrypt implies the ability to
decrypt, so the problem does not arise.

Proofs would be simpler if ClientKeyExch included A's name within
Crypt KB (Nonce PMS).  As things stand, there is much overlap between proofs
about that message (which B receives) and the stronger event
Notes A \<lbrace>Agent B, Nonce PMS\<rbrace>.

Protocol goals:
* M, serverK(NA,NB,M) and clientK(NA,NB,M) will be known only to the two
     parties (though A is not necessarily authenticated).

* B upon receiving CertVerify knows that A is present (But this
    message is optional!)

* A upon receiving ServerFinished knows that B is present

* Each party who has received a FINISHED message can trust that the other
  party agrees on all message components, including PA and PB (thus foiling
  rollback attacks).
