text \<open>
  This is a (rather trivial) example of program verification. We model a
  compiler for translating expressions to stack machine instructions, and
  prove its correctness wrt.\ some evaluation semantics.
\<close>


subsection \<open>Binary operations\<close>

text \<open>
  Binary operations are just functions over some type of values. This is both
  for abstract syntax and semantics, i.e.\ we use a ``shallow embedding''
  here.
\<close>

type_synonym 'val binop = "'val \<Rightarrow> 'val \<Rightarrow> 'val"


subsection \<open>Expressions\<close>

text \<open>
  The language of expressions is defined as an inductive type, consisting of
  variables, constants, and binary operations on expressions.
\<close>

datatype (dead 'adr, dead 'val) expr =
    Variable 'adr
  | Constant 'val
  | Binop "'val binop" "('adr, 'val) expr" "('adr, 'val) expr"

text \<open>
  Evaluation (wrt.\ some environment of variable assignments) is defined by
  primitive recursion over the structure of expressions.
\<close>

primrec eval :: "('adr, 'val) expr \<Rightarrow> ('adr \<Rightarrow> 'val) \<Rightarrow> 'val"
  where
    "eval (Variable x) env = env x"
  | "eval (Constant c) env = c"
  | "eval (Binop f e1 e2) env = f (eval e1 env) (eval e2 env)"


subsection \<open>Machine\<close>

text \<open>
  Next we model a simple stack machine, with three instructions.
\<close>

datatype (dead 'adr, dead 'val) instr =
    Const 'val
  | Load 'adr
  | Apply "'val binop"

text \<open>
  Execution of a list of stack machine instructions is easily defined as
  follows.
\<close>

primrec exec :: "(('adr, 'val) instr) list \<Rightarrow> 'val list \<Rightarrow> ('adr \<Rightarrow> 'val) \<Rightarrow> 'val list"
  where
    "exec [] stack env = stack"
  | "exec (instr # instrs) stack env =
      (case instr of
        Const c \<Rightarrow> exec instrs (c # stack) env
      | Load x \<Rightarrow> exec instrs (env x # stack) env
      | Apply f \<Rightarrow> exec instrs (f (hd stack) (hd (tl stack)) # (tl (tl stack))) env)"

definition execute :: "(('adr, 'val) instr) list \<Rightarrow> ('adr \<Rightarrow> 'val) \<Rightarrow> 'val"
  where "execute instrs env = hd (exec instrs [] env)"


subsection \<open>Compiler\<close>

text \<open>
  We are ready to define the compilation function of expressions to lists of
  stack machine instructions.
\<close>

primrec compile :: "('adr, 'val) expr \<Rightarrow> (('adr, 'val) instr) list"
  where
    "compile (Variable x) = [Load x]"
  | "compile (Constant c) = [Const c]"
  | "compile (Binop f e1 e2) = compile e2 @ compile e1 @ [Apply f]"


text \<open>
  The main result of this development is the correctness theorem for
  \<open>compile\<close>. We first establish a lemma about \<open>exec\<close> and list append.

    exec ys (exec xs stack env) env"

  \<^bigskip>
  In the proofs above, the \<open>simp\<close> method does quite a lot of work behind the
  scenes (mostly ``functional program execution''). Subsequently, the same
  reasoning is elaborated in detail --- at most one recursive function
  definition is used at a time. Thus we get a better idea of what is actually
  going on.
