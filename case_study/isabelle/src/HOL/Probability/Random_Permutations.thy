  Random permutations and folding over them.
  This provides the basic theory for the concept of doing something
  in a random order, e.g. inserting elements from a fixed set into a 
  data structure in random order.

  Choosing a set permutation (i.e. a distinct list with the same elements as the set)
  uniformly at random is the same as first choosing the first element of the list
  and then choosing the rest of the list as a permutation of the remaining set.

  A generic fold function that takes a function, an initial state, and a set 
  and chooses a random order in which it then traverses the set in the same 
  fashion as a left fold over a list.

  We now introduce a slightly generalised version of the above fold 
  operation that does not simply return the result in the end, but applies
  a monadic bind to it.
    This may seem somewhat arbitrary, but it is a common use case, e.g. 
  in the Social Decision Scheme of Random Serial Dictatorship, where 
  voters narrow down a set of possible winners in a random order and 
  the winner is chosen from the remaining set uniformly at random.
