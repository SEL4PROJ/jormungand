                       The Isabelle System Distribution

Version information

   This is some unidentified repository version of Isabelle.

   See the NEWS file in the distribution for details on user-relevant
   changes.

Installation

   Isabelle works on the three main platform families: Linux, Windows,
   and Mac OS X.  The application bundles from the Isabelle web page
   include sources, documentation, and add-on tools for all supported
   platforms.

   Some technical background information may be found in the Isabelle
   System Manual (directory doc).

User interface

   Isabelle/jEdit is an advanced Prover IDE based on jEdit and
   Isabelle/Scala.  It is the main example application of the
   Isabelle/PIDE framework, and the default user interface of
   Isabelle.  It provides a metaphor of continuous proof checking of a
   versioned collection of theory sources, with instantaneous feedback
   in real-time and rich semantic markup associated with the formal
   text.
