  In addition to named theorems, AutoCorres also stores definitions,
  theorems and other data in ML data structures.
  These can be useful for writing tools to process the AutoCorres output.

text \<open>
  Information about all AutoCorres-processed functions is stored in the
  AutoCorresFunctionInfo structure.

  This structure stores information for all files that have been translated.
  It consists of three levels:

  1. Filename of the translation unit.
  2. Phase: the initial phase stores the C parser's output, and each
       subsequent translation phase that AutoCorres performs is recorded as well.
  3. Function: Each function that is processed in a given phase.

  The final stage is FunctionInfo.TS (type strengthening).
  This shows the final definition of each function in file_info:

ML \<open>
  the (FunctionInfo.Phasetab.lookup file_info FunctionInfo.TS) |> Symtab.dest |> map snd
  |> app (fn f_info => writeln ("Definition of " ^ #name f_info ^ ":\n" ^

                           (Thm.prop_of (#definition f_info))))
\<close>
text \<open>
  The function_info record also contains other data, such as function calls
  and intermediate correctness theorems.
  See the FunctionInfo structure for a full description.
\<close>

text \<open>
  We can also retrieve all intermediate phases.
  Besides being informative, these are also used by AutoCorres
  to resume partial translations; see Incremental.thy.

  Note that the final @{term ac_corres} theorems are currently not stored
  in AutoCorresFunctionInfo; they are defined only as named theorems.
  (This is an oversight; there isn't any room in the current data structures
   for these theorems.)
