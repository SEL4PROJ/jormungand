This file describes the contents of this directory, briefly explanining
the functionality of each file.

AutoCorres.thy:
    The top-level theory for the auto-corres project. This file should
    be imported by users of the project, and itself includes all
    necessary theorems and ML code.

autocorres.ML:
    Implements the top-level auto-corres command run by users.

AutoCorresAttributes.thy:
attributes.ML:
    Installs new theory attributes (such as "[polish]") that are
    internally used by various stages in auto-corres to determine how
    intermediate specifications should be rewritten.

autocorres_data.ML:
    Sets up storage in Isabelle theory objects used to hold intermediate
    theorems and definitions.

CCorresE.thy:
L1Defs.thy:
SimplConv.thy:
simpl_conv.ML:
    Proof frameworks and functionality required to convert SIMPL
    specifications into monadic specifications. "CCorresE.thy"
    implements the underlying refinement framework, "L1Defs.thy"
    specialises it for our particular needs, while the other files use
    these framework to perform the conversion.

L1Peephole.thy:
    Contains theorems used to simplify specifications after they are
    first converted into monadic form. New peep-hole optimisations may
    be added here.

ExceptionRewrite.thy:
exception_rewrite.ML:
    Proof frameworks and code to rewrite monadic specifications to
    avoid using exceptions where possible.

WordAbstract.thy:
word_abstract.ML:
    Word abstraction framework and theorems.

CorresXF.thy:
L1Valid.thy:
L2Defs.thy:
LocalVarExtract.thy:
local_var_extract.ML:
prog.ML:
    Proof frameworks and functionality required to convert monadic
    specifications where local variables are stored in the state
    record into monadic specifications where bound variables are
    used for local variables.

    "CorresXF.thy" implements the underlying proof framework for
    lifting local variables. "L2Defs.thy" instantiates this framework
    for our particular needs. "L1Valid.thy" contains theories need
    to prove that local variables remain unchanged in certain fragments
    of code. The remaining files actually carry out the conversion.

l2_opt.ML:
L2Opt.thy:
L2Peephole.thy:
AutoCorresSimpset.thy:
    An implementation of "flow-sensitive" optimisations, which implement
    optimisations that can be aware of how local variables are used and
    their concrete values.

TypeStrengthen.thy:
type_strengthen.ML:
monad_convert.ML:
monad_types.ML:
    Theorems and functionality used to strengthen the type of
    specifications to a stronger type.

Polish.thy:
pretty_bound_var_names.ML:
    Rules used in the final "polishing" stage of abstraction, designed
    to introduce syntactic sugar and remove rough edges required only
    for proof automation.

SimplBucket.thy:
NonDetMonadEx.thy:
MonadMono.thy:
    Additional auxiliary lemmas and definitions that apply to HOL, SIMPL
    and the non-deterministic state monad respectively.

autocorres_util.ML:
utils.ML:
program_info.ML:
function_info.ML:
mkterm_antiquote.ML:
trace_antiquote.ML:
autocorres_trace.ML:
    Utility libraries used by the auto-corres tools. The former includes
    methods for iterating over source code projects, while the latter
    contains general-purpose functionality for interacting with the
    Isabelle theorem prover.

HeapLift.thy:
TypHeapSimple.thy:
ExecConcrete.thy:
heap_lift_base.ML:
heap_lift.ML:
record_utils.ML:
    Heap abstraction code.

statistics.ML:
    A tool for logging intermediate terms generated during conversion,
    used for debugging and understanding effectiveness of various
    optimisation stages.

AbstractArrays.thy:
DataStructures.thy:
    Helper theorems for reasoning about arrays and linked lists.
