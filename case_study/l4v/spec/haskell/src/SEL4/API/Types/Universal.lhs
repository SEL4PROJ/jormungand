This module defines the set of kernel object types that are available on all implementations.

\subsection{Types}

\subsubsection{Object Types}

The following is the definition of the five object types that are always available, as well as untyped memory. This enumeration may be extended on some platforms to add platform-specific object types.

> data APIObjectType
>         = Untyped
>         | TCBObject
>         | EndpointObject
>         | NotificationObject
>         | CapTableObject
>         deriving (Enum, Bounded, Eq, Show)

%FIXME: TCB size is now possibly arch-dependent

> tcbBlockSizeBits :: Int
> tcbBlockSizeBits = 9

> epSizeBits :: Int
> epSizeBits = 4

> ntfnSizeBits :: Int
> ntfnSizeBits = 4

> cteSizeBits :: Int
> cteSizeBits = 4

> apiGetObjectSize :: APIObjectType -> Int -> Int
> apiGetObjectSize Untyped size = size
> apiGetObjectSize TCBObject _ = tcbBlockSizeBits
> apiGetObjectSize EndpointObject _ = epSizeBits
> apiGetObjectSize NotificationObject _ = ntfnSizeBits
> apiGetObjectSize CapTableObject size = cteSizeBits + size
