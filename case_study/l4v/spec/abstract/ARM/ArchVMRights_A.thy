  Note that only the above combinations of virtual-memory rights are permitted.
  We introduce the following definitions to reflect this fact:
  The predicate @{text valid_vm_rights} holds iff a given set of rights is valid
  (i.e., a permitted combination).
  The function @{text validate_vm_rights} takes an arbitrary set of rights and
  returns the largest permitted subset.
